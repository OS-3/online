    About us
</h2>
<p>
    Since 2021, OS<sup>3</sup> has developed software that helps with every day life, entirely open source and free.
    <br>
    All our programs are desgined to help you for free, where elsewhere, the functionality would cost you vast sums of money
    <br>
    As the programs are free, they have limited field testing, so you are encouraged to make bug reports if you find errors in the software
    which will be fixed in the next release. Bug reports can be made by emailing us <a href=mailto:os3@gmail.com>here</a>
